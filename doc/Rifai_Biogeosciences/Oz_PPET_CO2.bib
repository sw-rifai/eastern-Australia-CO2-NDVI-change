	abstract = {All but four of 833 native and 292 naturalised Australian grasses (Poaceae) have been assigned as having the C 3 or C4 photosynthetic pathway. In conjunction with comprehensive species composition data for 75 geographic subdivisions Australiawide, this has permitted the construction of distribution maps for C 3 and C4 grasses. C3 and C4 grass distributions have been considered (i) independently, using subdivisional native species numbers; and (ii) relatively, using 'subdivisional \% C4'. C3 species are most numerous in the Southern Tablelands (New South Wales), the {QZ} subdivision (Victoria), and Tasmania; C4 species in the northern Northern Territory and northern Queensland, including the Cook subdivision where 54\% of Australia's native C4 grasses can be found. C3 species predominate only in south-west Western Australia, parts of southern South Australia, the Tablelands, central and south coast, and south western slopes of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. C4 species predominate over 80-85\% of the continental area. For 16 temperature and rainfall variables, subdivisional area-weighted means were calculated, and correlation analyses performed. C 3 species number correlates most highly with January average maximum temperature ( - v e ) and spring rainfall (+ ve); C4 species number with October average minimum temperature (+ve) and February median rainfall (+ ve); ' \% C4' with January average minimum temperature (+ ve). Predictive multiple linear regression equations were generated using climatic variables. In general, C4 grass species, like C 3 species, increase in number with increasing rainfall, in their preferred temperature regime. C, species are most numerous where the summer is hot and wet; C 3 species where the spring is cool and wet. C4 species numbers decline with decreasing temperature and/or decreasing summer rainfall; C3 species numbers decline with increasing temperature and/or decreasing spring rainfall. Results are also considered in relation to the taxonomic and physiological heterogeneity of grasses and to Australia's geobotanic history.},

These quantities can be derived indirectly from meteorological variables, such as near-surface air temperature, precipitation and cloudiness. Here we present a consolidated set of simple process-led algorithms for simulating habitats ({SPLASH}) allowing robust approximations of key quantities at ecologically relevant timescales. We specify equations, derivations, simplifications, and assumptions for the estimation of daily and monthly quantities of top-of-the-atmosphere solar radiation, net surface radiation, photosynthetic photon flux density, evapotranspiration (potential, equilibrium, and actual), condensation, soil moisture, and runoff, based on analysis of their relationship to fundamental climatic drivers. The climatic drivers include a minimum of three meteorological inputs: precipitation, air temperature, and fraction of bright sunshine hours. Indices, such as the moisture index, the climatic water deficit, and the Priestley–Taylor coefficient, are also defined. The {SPLASH} code is transcribed in C++, {FORTRAN}, Python, and R. A total of 1 year of results are presented at the local and global scales to exemplify the spatiotemporal patterns of daily and monthly model outputs along with comparisons to other model results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Using the latest {HadGHCND} daily temperature dataset, global trends in observed summertime heatwaves and annually calculated warm spells for 1950–2011 are analysed via a multi-index, multi-aspect framework. Three indices that separately focus on maximum temperature ({TX}90pct), minimum temperature ({TN}90pct) and average temperature ({EHF}) were studied with respect to five characteristics of event intensity, frequency and duration. Despite which index is employed, increases in heatwave/warm spell intensity, frequency and duration are found. Furthermore, {TX}90pct and {TN}90pct trends are larger and exhibit more significance for warm spells, implying that non-summer events are driving annual trends over some regions. Larger increases in {TN}90pct aspects relative to {EHF} and {TX}90pct are also observed. While qualitative information on event trends is similar across the indices, quantitative values vary. This result highlights the importance of employing the most appropriate index when assessing the impact of sustained extreme temperature events.},

	abstract = {As the first step in an attempt to paint a broad picture of the growth of perennial
evergreen plant communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea, a model of water
use by these ecosystems has been deveioped with use of monthly climatic data.
The leaf area index of such communities in Australia appears to remain relatively
constant throughout the year.
Monthly water balance observations on seven perennial evergreen plant com-
munities - in regions ranging from arid to humid in southern Australia - reveal a
linear relationship between the ratio of community evapotranspiration to pan evapora-
tion (Ea/Eo) and the water store (W) for that month (monthly precipitation plus
extractable soil water at the beginning of the month (P + Sext)):
Ea/Eo = k(P + Sext) .
As the community matures towards the climax condition, the coefficient k in this
relationship is shown to approach a maximal value in which extractable soil water
(Sext) approaches zero but rarely, if ever, equals zero during the driest time of the
year. The coefficient k provides an index of the maximal complexity of structure
and physiology possible in plant communities growing in the particular region.
The linear relationship appears to hold until the water store (W) approaches
saturation, when Ea/Eo tends to equal or slightly exceed 1.0.
These water use equations have been applied to the climatic data of 347 climatic
stations in Australia and 10 in Papua New Guinea, on the assumptions that: (1) all
precipitation enters the soil; (2) the topography is level; (3) the plant community
is evergreen and perennial with a relatively constant leaf area index. Maps have been
prepared showing the maximal values of k ; the mean annual value of Ea/Eo (when
drainage results as soon as Sext exceeds 5.0 or 30.0 cm, arbitrarily chosen low and
high values respectively), and the optimal amount of extractable soil moisture which
may be held in the soil of the region.
The influence of various environmental and biotic factors on the water balance
operating in the ecosystem is explored. The effects of topography and insolation,
run-off/run-on, microdistribution of precipitation, rainfall interception and stem
flow, variation in distribution and amount of extractable soil water, waterlogging,
root distribution, and seasonal changes in foliage projective cover have been investigated
from ecological studies reported in the literature.
The foliage projective cover of climax evergreen plant communities is shown
to increase linearly as the maximal value of k increases from region to region.
Provided internal drainage does not occur, the maximal value of the coefficient
k for any climatic station is not affected by the addition or subtraction of water by
run-on or run-off; the mean annual value of Ea/Eo increases linearly from zero as
the water entering the soil increases. In contrast, the effect of topography on insolation
induces an inverse response in both the maximal value of k and the mean annual
value of Ea/Eo as radiation (and pan evaporation) increases.
The feasibility of using the monthly values of Ea/Eo to estimate growth of
perennial evergreen plant communities is discussed.},

	abstract = {Leaf area index ({LAI}) is a key variable in modeling terrestrial vegetation because it has a major impact on carbon and water ﬂuxes. However, several recent intercomparisons have shown that modeled {LAI} differs signiﬁcantly among models and between models and satellite-derived estimates. Empirical studies show that {LAI} is strongly related to precipitation. This observation is predicted by the ecohydrological equilibrium theory, which provides an alternative means to predict steady state {LAI}. We implemented this theory in a simple optimization model. We hypothesized that, when water availability is limited, plants should adjust steady state {LAI} and stomatal behavior to maximize net canopy carbon export, under the constraint that canopy transpiration is a ﬁxed fraction of total precipitation. We evaluated the predicted {LAI} (Lopt) for Australia against ground-based observations of {LAI} at 135 sites and continental-scale satellite-derived estimates. For the site-level data, the root-mean-square error of predicted Lopt was 1.07 m2 {mÀ}2, similar to the root-mean-square error of a comparison of the data against 9-year mean satellite-derived {LAI} (Lsat) at those sites. Continentally, Lopt had an R2 of 0.7 when compared to Lsat. The predicted Lopt increased continental-wide with rising atmospheric [{CO}2] over 1982–2010, which agreed with satellite-derived estimations, while the predicted stomatal behavior responded differently in dry and wet regions. Our results indicate that long-term equilibrium {LAI} can be successfully predicted from a simple application of ecohydrological theory. We suggest that this theory could be usefully incorporated into terrestrial vegetation models to improve their predictions of {LAI}.},

The results from free-air {CO}2 enrichment ({FACE}) experiments were summarized via meta-analysis to quantify the mean responses of stomatal and photosynthetic parameters to elevated [{CO}2]. Elevation of [{CO}2] in {FACE} experiments reduced stomatal conductance by 22\%, yet, this reduction was not associated with a similar change in stomatal density. Elevated [{CO}2] stimulated light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat) in C3 plants grown in {FACE} by an average of 31\%. However, the magnitude of the increase in Asat varied with functional group and environment. Functional groups with ribulose1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)-limited photosynthesis at elevated [{CO}2] had greater potential for increases in Asat than those where photosynthesis became ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate ({RubP})-limited at elevated [{CO}2]. Both nitrogen supply and sink capacity modulated the response of photosynthesis to elevated [{CO}2] through their impact on the acclimation of carboxylation capacity. Increased understanding of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which plants respond to elevated [{CO}2], and the feedback of environmental factors upon them, will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to rising [{CO}2] and increase our potential to adapt crops and managed ecosystems to future atmospheric [{CO}2].},

Trends in vegetation cover are interpreted within Budyko’s energy – water limitation framework. Results from an Australia-wide analysis indicate that vegetation cover (as described by the fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation; {fPAR}) has increased, on average, by 0.0007 per year – an increase of \$ 8\% over the 26 years. The majority of this change is due to a 0.0010 per year increase in persistent {fPAR} (representing nondeciduous perennial vegetation types; up 21\%). In contrast, recurrent {fPAR} (representing deciduous, annual and ephemeral vegetation types) decreased, on average, by 0.0003 per year (down 7\%), the trends of which are highly seasonal. Over the same period, Australian average annual precipitation increased by 1.3 mm {yrÀ}2 (up 7\%). A site-based analysis using 90 long-term meteorological stations with minimal localized land-cover changes showed that energy-limited sites where total {fPAR} increased generally experienced decreases in precipitation, and water-limited sites that experienced decreases in cover were almost always associated with decreases in precipitation. Interestingly, where vegetation cover increased at water-limited sites, precipitation trends were variable indicating that this is not the only factor driving vegetation response. As Australia is a generally highly water-limited environment, these ﬁndings indicate that the effective availability of water to plants has increased on average over the study period. Results also show that persistent vegetation types have beneﬁted more than recurrent types from recent changes in growing conditions. Regardless of what has been driving these changes, the overall response of vegetation over the past 2–3 decades has resulted in an observable greening of the driest inhabited continent on Earth.},

	abstract = {South-East Australia has recently been subjected to two of the worst droughts in the historical record (Millennium Drought, 2000–2009 and Big Dry, 2017–2019). Unfortunately, a lack of forest monitoring has made it difficult to determine whether widespread tree mortality has resulted from these droughts. Anecdotal observations suggest the Big Dry may have led to more significant tree mortality than the Millennium drought. Critically, to be able to robustly project future expected climate change effects on Australian vegetation, we need to assess the vulnerability of Australian trees to drought. Here we implemented a model of plant hydraulics into the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange ({CABLE}) land surface model. We parameterized the drought response behaviour of five broad vegetation types, based on a common garden dry-down experiment with species originating across a rainfall gradient (188–1,125 mm/year) across South-East Australia. The new hydraulics model significantly improved ({\textasciitilde}35\%–45\% reduction in root mean square error) {CABLE}’s previous predictions of latent heat fluxes during periods of water stress at two eddy covariance sites in Australia. Landscape-scale predictions of the greatest percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity ({PLC}) of about 40\%–60\%, were broadly consistent with satellite estimates of regions of the greatest change in both droughts. In neither drought did {CABLE} predict that trees would have reached critical {PLC} in widespread areas (i.e. it projected a low mortality risk), although the model highlighted critical levels near the desert regions of South-East Australia where few trees live. Overall, our experimentally constrained model results imply significant resilience to drought conferred by hydraulic function, but also highlight critical data and scientific gaps. Our approach presents a promising avenue to integrate experimental data and make regional-scale predictions of potential droughtinduced hydraulic failure.},

	abstract = {Forest and savanna biomes dominate the tropics, yet factors controlling their distribution remain poorly understood. Climate is clearly important, but extensive savannas in some high rainfall areas suggest a decoupling of climate and vegetation. In some situations edaphic factors are important, with forest often associated with high nutrient availability. Fire also plays a key role in limiting forest, with ﬁre exclusion often causing a switch from savanna to forest. These observations can be captured by a broad conceptual model with two components: (1) forest and savanna are alternative stable states, maintained by tree cover-ﬁre feedbacks, (2) the interaction between tree growth rates and ﬁre frequency limits forest development; any factor that increases growth (e.g. elevated availability of water, nutrients, {CO}2), or decreases ﬁre frequency, will favour canopy closure. This model is consistent with the range of environmental variables correlated with forest distribution, and with the current trend of forest expansion, likely driven by increasing {CO}2 concentrations. Resolving the drivers of forest and savanna distribution has moved beyond simple correlative studies that are unlikely to establish ultimate causation. Experiments using Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, parameterised with measurements from each continent, provide an important tool for understanding the controls of these systems.},

	abstract = {Landscape change occurs through the interaction of a multitude of natural and human driving forces at a range of organisational levels, with humans playing an increasingly dominant role in many regions of the world. Building on the current knowledge of the underlying drivers of landscape change, a conceptual framework of regional landscape change was developed which integrated population, economic and cultural values, policy and science/technology. Using the Southern Brigalow Belt biogeographic region of Queensland as a case study, the role of natural and human drivers in landscape change was investigated in four phases of settlement since 1840. The Brigalow Belt has experienced comparable rates of vegetation clearance over the past 50 years to areas of tropical deforestation. Economic factors were important during all phases of development, but the ﬁve regional drivers often acted in synergy. Environmental constraints played a signiﬁcant role in slowing rates of change. Temporal trends of deforestation followed a sigmoidal curve, with initial slow change accelerating though the middle phases then slowing in recent times. Future landscape management needs to take account of the inﬂuence of all the components of the conceptual framework, at a range of organisational levels, if more ecologically sustainable outcomes are to be achieved.},

Because L responds to environmental drivers, it can represent an important feedback to climate change, but its responses to rising atmospheric [{CO}2] and water availability of forests have been poorly quantiﬁed. We studied canopy leaf area dynamics for 28 months in a native evergreen Eucalyptus woodland exposed to free-air {CO}2 enrichment (the {EucFACE} experiment), in a subtropical climate where water limitation is common. We hypothesized that, because of expected stimulation of productivity and water-use efﬁciency, L should increase with elevated [{CO}2]. We estimated L from diffuse canopy transmittance, and measured monthly leaf litter production. Contrary to expectation, L did not respond to elevated [{CO}2]. We found that L varied between 1.10 and 2.20 across the study period. The dynamics of L showed a quick increase after heavy rainfall and a steady decrease during periods of low rainfall. Leaf litter production was correlated to changes in L, both during periods of decreasing L (when no leaf growth occurred) and during periods of increasing L (active shedding of old foliage when new leaf growth occurred). Leaf lifespan, estimated from mean L and total annual litter production, was up to 2 months longer under elevated [{CO}2] (1.18 vs. 1.01 years; P = 0.05). Our main ﬁnding that L was not responsive to elevated {CO}2 is consistent with other forest {FACE} studies, but contrasts with the positive response of L commonly predicted by many ecosystem models.},

The Eucalyptus Free-Air {CO}2 Enrichment ({EucFACE}) experiment was established to study the effects of elevated atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations ({eCO}2) on a native mature eucalypt woodland with low fertility soils in southeast Australia. In contrast to other {FACE} experiments, the concentration of {CO}2 at {EucFACE} was increased gradually in steps above ambient (+0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 ppm {CO}2 above ambient of {\textasciitilde}400 ppm), with each step lasting approximately 5 weeks. This provided a unique opportunity to study the short-term (weeks to months) response of C cycle ﬂux components to {eCO}2 across a range of {CO}2 concentrations in an intact ecosystem. Soil {CO}2 efﬂux (i.e., soil respiration or Rsoil) increased in response to initial enrichment (e.g., +30 and +60 ppm {CO}2) but did not continue to increase as the {CO}2 enrichment was stepped up to higher concentrations. Light-saturated photosynthesis of canopy leaves (Asat) also showed similar stimulation by elevated {CO}2 at +60 ppm as at +150 ppm {CO}2. The lack of signiﬁcant effects of {eCO}2 on soil moisture, microbial biomass, or activity suggests that the increase in Rsoil likely reﬂected increased root and rhizosphere respiration rather than increased microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. This rapid increase in Rsoil suggests that under {eCO}2, additional photosynthate was produced, transported belowground, and respired. The consequences of this increased belowground activity and whether it is sustained through time in mature ecosystems under {eCO}2 are a priority for future research.},

Whilst understanding nutrient constraints on productivity responses to {eCO}2 is crucial for predicting carbon uptake and storage, very little is known about how {eCO}2 affects nutrient cycling in phosphorus (P)-limited ecosystems. Our study investigates {eCO}2 effects on soil N and P dynamics at the {EucFACE} experiment in Western Sydney over an 18-month period. Three ambient and three {eCO}2 (+150 ppm) {FACE} rings were installed in a P-limited, mature Cumberland Plain Eucalyptus woodland. Levels of plant accessible nutrients, evaluated using ion exchange resins, were increased under {eCO}2, compared to ambient, for nitrate (+93\%), ammonium (+12\%) and phosphate (+54\%). There was a strong seasonality to responses, particularly for phosphate, resulting in a relatively greater stimulation in available P, compared to N, under {eCO}2 in spring and summer. {eCO}2 was also associated with faster nutrient turnover rates in the ﬁrst six months of the experiment, with higher N (+175\%) and P (+211\%) mineralization rates compared to ambient rings, although this difference did not persist. Seasonally dependant effects of {eCO}2 were seen for concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in soil solution (+31\%), and there was also a reduction in bulk soil {pH} (-0.18 units) observed under {eCO}2. These results demonstrate that {CO}2 fertilization increases nutrient availability – particularly for phosphate – in P-limited soils, likely via increased plant belowground investment in labile carbon and associated enhancement of microbial turnover of organic matter and mobilization of chemically bound P. Early evidence suggests that there is the potential for the observed increases in P availability to support increased ecosystem C-accumulation under future predicted {CO}2 concentrations.},

Each {NOAA} satellite experienced orbital drift during its duty period, which influenced the {AVHRR} reflectance measurements. To understand the effect of the orbital drift on the {AVHRR}-derived {RSP} dataset, we analyzed the impact of solar zenith angle ({SZA}) on the {RSP} metrics in the conterminous United States ({CONUS}). The {AVHRR} weekly composites were used to calculate the growing-season median {SZA} at the pixel level for each year from 1989 to 2014. The results showed that the {SZA} increased towards the end of each {NOAA} satellite mission with the highest increasing rate occurring during {NOAA}-11 (1989–1994) and {NOAA}-14 (1995–2000) missions. The growing-season median {SZA} values (44°–60°) in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1999, and 2000 were substantially higher than those in other years (28°–40°). The high {SZA} in those years caused negative trends in the {SZA} time series, that were statistically significant (at α=0.05 level) in 76.9\% of the {CONUS} area. A pixel-based temporal correlation analysis showed that the phenological metrics and {SZA} were significantly correlated (at α=0.05 level) in 4.1–20.4\% of the {CONUS} area. After excluding the 5 years with high {SZA} ({\textgreater}40°) from the analysis, the temporal {SZA} trend was largely reduced, significantly affecting less than 2\% of the study area. Additionally, significant correlation between the phenological metrics and {SZA} was observed in less than 7\% of the study area. Our study concluded that the {NOAA} satellite orbital drift increased {SZA}, and in turn, influenced the phenological metrics. Elimination of the years with high median {SZA} reduced the influence of orbital drift on the {RSP} time series.},

Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains.
Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.
Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

	abstract = {Models of vegetation function are widely used to predict the effects of climate change on carbon, water and nutrient cycles of terrestrial ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Stomatal conductance, the process that governs plant water use and carbon uptake, is fundamental to such models. In this paper, we reconcile two long-standing theories of stomatal conductance. The empirical approach, which is most commonly used in vegetation models, is phenomenological, based on experimental observations of stomatal behaviour in response to environmental conditions. The optimal approach is based on the theoretical argument that stomata should act to minimize the amount of water used per unit carbon gained. We reconcile these two approaches by showing that the theory of optimal stomatal conductance can be used to derive a model of stomatal conductance that is closely analogous to the empirical models. Consequently, we obtain a uniﬁed stomatal model which has a similar form to existing empirical models, but which now provides a theoretical interpretation for model parameter values. The key model parameter, g1, is predicted to increase with growth temperature and with the marginal water cost of carbon gain. The new model is ﬁtted to a range of datasets ranging from tropical to boreal trees. The parameter g1 is shown to vary with growth temperature, as predicted, and also with plant functional type. The model is shown to correctly capture responses of stomatal conductance to changing atmospheric {CO}2, and thus can be used to test for stomatal acclimation to elevated {CO}2. The reconciliation of the optimal and empirical approaches to modelling stomatal conductance is important for global change biology because it provides a simple theoretical framework for analyzing, and simulating, the coupling between carbon and water cycles under environmental change.},

	abstract = {Detailed spatial information on the presence and properties of woody vegetation serves many purposes, including carbon accounting, environmental reporting and land management. Here, we investigated whether machine learning can be used to combine multiple spatial observations and training data to estimate woody vegetation canopy cover fraction (‘cover’), vegetation height (‘height’) and woody above-ground biomass dry matter (‘biomass’) at 25-m resolution across the Australian continent, where possible on an annual basis. We trained a Random Forest algorithm on cover and height estimates derived from airborne {LiDAR} over 11 regions and inventory-based biomass estimates for many thousands of plots across Australia. As predictors, we used annual geomedian Landsat surface reflectance, {ALOS}/{PALSAR} L-band radar backscatter mosaics, spatial vegetation structure data derived primarily from {ICESat}/{GLAS} satellite altimetry, and spatial climate data. Cross-validation experiments were undertaken to optimize the selection of predictors and the configuration of the algorithm. The resulting estimation errors were 0.07 for cover, 3.4 m for height, and 80 t dry matter ha-1 for biomass. A large fraction (89–94 \%) of the observed variance was explained in each case. Priorities for future research include validation of the {LiDAR}-derived cover training data and the use of new satellite vegetation height data from the {GEDI} mission. Annual cover mapping for 2000–2018 provided detailed insight in woody vegetation dynamics. Continentally, woody vegetation change was primarily driven by water availability and its effect on bushfire and mortality, particularly in the drier interior. Changes in woody vegetation made a substantial contribution to Australia’s total carbon emissions since 2000. Whether these ecosystems will recover biomass in future remains to be seen, given the persistent pressures of climate change and land use.},

Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the {MODIS} Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) {MCD}64A1 and {MCD}45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 {MCD}64A1 products for fifteen years (2002–2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26\%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6\% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44\% of the C6 {MCD}64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68\% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 {MCD}64A1 and {MCD}45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.},

	abstract = {Water use efficiency is a critical index for describing carbon-water coupling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the nonlinear effect of vapor pressure deficit ({VPD}) on carbon-water coupling has not been fully considered. To improve the relationship between gross primary production ({GPP}) and evapotranspiration ({ET}) at the subdaily time scale, we propose a new underlying water use efficiency ({uWUE} = {GPP} · {VPD}0.5/{ET}) and a hysteresis model to minimize time lags among {GPP}, {ET}, and {VPD}. Half-hourly data were used to validate {uWUE} for seven vegetation types from 42 {AmeriFlux} sites. Correlation analysis shows that the {GPP} · {VPD}0.5 and {ET} relationship (r = 0.844) is better than that between {GPP} · {VPD} and {ET} (r = 0.802). The hysteresis model supports the {GPP} · {VPD}0.5 and {ET} relationship. As {uWUE} is related to {CO}2 concentration, its use can improve estimates of {GPP} and {ET} and help understand the effect of {CO}2 fertilization on carbon storage and water loss.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Phenology is the study of periodic biological occurrences and can provide important insights into the influence of climatic variability and change on ecosystems. Understanding Australia's vegetation phenology is a challenge due to its diverse range of ecosystems, from savannas and tropical rainforests to temperate eucalypt woodlands, semi-arid scrublands, and alpine grasslands. These ecosystems exhibit marked differences in seasonal patterns of canopy development and plant life-cycle events, much of which deviates from the predictable seasonal phenological pulse of temperate deciduous and boreal biomes. Many Australian ecosystems are subject to irregular events (i.e. drought, flooding, cyclones, and fire) that can alter ecosystem composition, structure, and functioning just as much as seasonal change. We show how satellite remote sensing and ground-based digital repeat photography (i.e. phenocams) can be used to improve understanding of phenology in Australian ecosystems. First, we examine temporal variation in phenology on the continental scale using the enhanced vegetation index ({EVI}), calculated from {MODerate} resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}) data. Spatial gradients are revealed, ranging from regions with pronounced seasonality in canopy development (i.e. tropical savannas) to regions where seasonal variation is minimal (i.e. tropical rainforests) or high but irregular (i.e. arid ecosystems). Next, we use time series colour information extracted from phenocam imagery to illustrate a range of phenological signals in four contrasting Australian ecosystems. These include greening and senescing events in tropical savannas and temperate eucalypt understorey, as well as strong seasonal dynamics of individual trees in a seemingly static evergreen rainforest. We also demonstrate how phenology links with ecosystem gross primary productivity (from eddy covariance) and discuss why these processes are linked in some ecosystems but not others. We conclude that phenocams have the potential to greatly improve the current understanding of Australian ecosystems. To facilitate the sharing of this information, we have formed the Australian Phenocam Network (http://phenocam.org.au/).},

	abstract = {Abstract. Savanna ecosystems cover 20 \% of the global land surface and account for 25 \% of global terrestrial carbon uptake. They support one fifth of the world's human population and are one of the most important ecosystems on our planet. Savanna productivity is a product of the interplay between trees and grass that co-dominate savanna landscapes and are maintained through interactions with climate and disturbance (fire, land use change, herbivory). In this study, we evaluate the temporally dynamic partitioning of overstory and understory carbon dioxide fluxes in Australian tropical savanna using overstory and understory eddy covariance measurements. Over a 2-year period (September 2012 to October 2014) the overall net ecosystem productivity ({NEP}) of the savanna was 506.2 (±22 {SE}) g C m−2 yr−1. The total gross primary productivity ({GPP}) was 2267.1 (±80 {SE}) g C m−2 yr−1, of which the understory contributed 32 \%. The understory contribution was strongly seasonal, with most {GPP} occurring in the wet season (40 \% of total ecosystem in the wet season and 18 \% in the dry). This study is the first to elucidate the temporal dynamics of savanna understory and overstory carbon flux components explicitly using observational information. Understanding grass productivity is crucial for evaluating fuel loads, as is tree productivity for quantifying the tree carbon sink. This information will contribute to a significant refinement of the representation of savannas in models, as well as improved understanding of relative tree-grass productivity and competition for resources.},

Here, two satellite-observed vegetation products were used to study the long-term (1988–2008) vegetation changes of global drylands: the widely used reflective-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ({NDVI}) and the recently developed passive-microwave-based Vegetation Optical Depth ({VOD}). The {NDVI} is sensitive to the chlorophyll concentrations in the canopy and the canopy cover fraction, while the {VOD} is sensitive to vegetation water content of both leafy and woody components. Therefore it can be expected that using both products helps to better characterize vegetation dynamics, particularly over regions with mixed herbaceous and woody vegetation. Linear regression analysis was performed between antecedent precipitation and observed {NDVI} and {VOD} independently to distinguish the contribution of climatic and non-climatic drivers in vegetation variations. Where possible, the contributions of fire, grazing, agriculture and {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ level to vegetation trends were assessed. The results suggest that {NDVI} is more sensitive to fluctuations in herbaceous vegetation, which primarily uses shallow soil water, whereas {VOD} is more sensitive to woody vegetation, which additionally can exploit deeper water stores. Globally, evidence is found for woody encroachment over drylands. In the arid drylands, woody encroachment appears to be at the expense of herbaceous vegetation and a global driver is interpreted. Trends in semi-arid drylands vary widely between regions, suggesting that local rather than global drivers caused most of the vegetation response. In savannas, besides precipitation, fire regime plays an important role in shaping trends. Our results demonstrate that {NDVI} and {VOD} provide complementary information and allow new insights into dryland vegetation dynamics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Semi-arid areas, defined as those areas of the world where water is an important limitation for plant growth, have become the subject of increased interest due to the impacts of current global changes and sustainability of human lifestyles. While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of semi-arid areas using {AVHRR} {GIMMS} from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in semi-arid areas across the globe. It is concluded that semi-arid areas, across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0.015 {NDVI} units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in semi-arid areas where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0.019 {NDVI} units) and in semi-arid areas where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0.013 {NDVI} units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in semi-arid areas worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness.},

The greening phenomenon, together with warming, sea-level rise and sea-ice decline, represents highly credible evidence of anthropogenic climate change. In this Review, we examine the detection of the greening signal, its causes and its consequences. Greening is pronounced over intensively farmed or afforested areas, such as in China and India, reflecting human activities. However, strong greening also occurs in biomes with low human footprint, such as the Arctic, where global change drivers play a dominant role. Vegetation models suggest that {CO}2 fertilization is the main driver of greening on the global scale, with other factors being notable at the regional scale. Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by increasing the carbon sink on land and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling. Coupling high temporal and fine spatial resolution remote-sensing observations with ground measurements, increasing sampling in the tropics and Arctic, and modelling Earth systems in more detail will further our insights into the greening of Earth.},

Terrestrial gross primary production derived from two satellite-based models (revised {EC}-{LUE} and {MODIS}) exhibits persistent and widespread decreases after the late 1990s due to increased {VPD}, which offset the positive {CO}2 fertilization effect.

	abstract = {A decline in the carbon fertilization effect
One source of uncertainty in climate science is how the carbon fertilization effect ({CFE}) will contribute to mitigation of anthropogenic climate change. Wang et al. explored the temporal dynamics of {CFE} on vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale. There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of {CFE} to vegetation photosynthesis, perhaps owing to the limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle models. {CFE} thus has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated.
Science, this issue p. 1295
The enhanced vegetation productivity driven by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) [i.e., the {CO}2 fertilization effect ({CFE})] sustains an important negative feedback on climate warming, but the temporal dynamics of {CFE} remain unclear. Using multiple long-term satellite- and ground-based datasets, we showed that global {CFE} has declined across most terrestrial regions of the globe from 1982 to 2015, correlating well with changing nutrient concentrations and availability of soil water. Current carbon cycle models also demonstrate a declining {CFE} trend, albeit one substantially weaker than that from the global observations. This declining trend in the forcing of terrestrial carbon sinks by increasing amounts of atmospheric {CO}2 implies a weakening negative feedback on the climatic system and increased societal dependence on future strategies to mitigate climate warming.
Satellite- and ground-based observations reveal that plant growth responses to increased atmospheric {CO}2 levels have declined.

	abstract = {Atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen is critical to the function of ecosystems and elemental cycles. During the industrial period, humans have doubled the amount of inorganic nitrogen in the biosphere and radically altered rates of atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Despite this rapid change, estimates of global nitrogen deposition patterns generally have low, centennial-scale temporal resolution. Lack of information on annual- to decadal-scale changes in global nitrogen deposition makes it difficult for scientists researching questions on these finer timescales to contextualize their work within the global nitrogen cycle. Here we use the {GEOS}-Chem Chemical Transport Model to estimate wet and dry deposition of inorganic nitrogen globally at a spatial resolution of 2° × 2.5° for 12 individual years in the period from 1984 to 2016. During this time, we found an 8\% increase in global inorganic nitrogen deposition from 86.6 to 93.6 {TgN}/year, a trend that comprised a balance of variable regional patterns. For example, inorganic nitrogen deposition increased in areas including East Asia and Southern Brazil, while inorganic nitrogen deposition declined in areas including Europe. Further, we found a global increase in the percentage of inorganic nitrogen deposited in chemically reduced forms from 30\% to 35\%, and this trend was largely driven by strong regional increases in the proportion of chemically reduced nitrogen deposited over the United States. This study provides spatially explicit estimates of inorganic nitrogen deposition over the last four decades and improves our understanding of short-term human impacts on the global nitrogen cycle.},

	abstract = {For the past century, woody plants have increased in grasslands and savannas worldwide. Woody encroachment may significantly alter ecosystem functioning including fire regimes, herbivore carrying capacity, biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. Traditionally, increases in woody cover and density have been ascribed to changes in the disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) or rainfall. Increased atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations may also contribute, by increasing growth rates of trees relative to grasses. This hypothesis is still heavily debated because usually potential {CO}2 effects are confounded by changes in land use (disturbance regime). Here we analyse changes in woody density in fire experiments at three sites in South African savannas where the disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) was kept constant for 30 and 50 years. If global drivers had significant effects on woody plants, we would expect significant increases in tree densities and biomass over time under the constant disturbance regime. Woody density remained constant in a semiarid savanna but tripled in a mesic savanna between the 1970s and 1990s. At the third site, a semiarid savanna near the southern limits of the biome, tree density doubled from the mid 1990s to 2010. Interpretation of the causes is confounded by population recovery after clearing, but aerial photograph analysis on adjacent non-cleared areas showed an accompanying 48\% increase in woody cover. Increased {CO}2 concentrations are consistent with increased woody density while other global drivers (rainfall) remained constant over the duration of the experiments. The absence of a response in one semiarid savanna could be explained by a smaller carbon sink capacity of the dominant species, which would therefore benefit less from increased {CO}2. Understanding how savannas and grasslands respond to increased {CO}2 and identifying the causes of woody encroachment are essential for the successful management of these systems.},

Our argument combines knowledge of tree recovery from injury after grassland fires, with theory about carbon acquisition and carbohydrate storage patterns in C3 woody plants in response to elevated {CO}2. We propose simply that elevated {CO}2 will tend to favour regrowth of juvenile trees trapped (sometimes for decades) in the ‘topkill’ zone, thus allowing them to escape more readily from periodic fires as {CO}2 continues to rise. Little empirical evidence exists to test this hypothesis, even though the process may have important implications for tree/grass codominated ecosystems currently in a dynamic equilibrium.},

Two different expressions of El Niño have recently been identified: (i) Central\&ndash;Pacific ({CP}) and (ii) Eastern\&ndash;Pacific ({EP}). Both types of El Nino are characterised by above average sea surface temperature anomalies in the respective locations. Studies exploring the impact of these expressions of El Niño on the carbon cycle have identified changes in the amplitude of the concentration of interannual atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$) variability, as well as different lags in terrestrial {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$ release to the atmosphere following increased tropical near surface air temperature. We employ the dynamic global vegetation model {LPJ}\&ndash;{GUESS} within a synthetic experimental framework to examine the sensitivity and potential long term impacts of these two expressions of El Niño on the terrestrial carbon cycle. We manipulated the occurrence of {CP} and {EP} events in two climate reanalysis datasets during the later half of the 20th and early 21st century by replacing all {EP} with {CP} and separately all {CP} with {EP} El Niño events. We found that the different expressions of El Niño affect interannual variability in the terrestrial carbon cycle. However, the effect on longer timescales was negligible for both climate reanalysis datasets. We conclude that capturing any future trends in the relative frequency of {CP} and {EP} El Niño events may not be critical for robust simulations of the terrestrial carbon cycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aridity is a complex concept that ideally requires a comprehensive assessment of hydroclimatological and hydroecological variables to fully understand anticipated changes. A widely used (offline) impact model to assess projected changes in aridity is the aridity index ({AI}) (defined as the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation), summarizing the aridity concept into a single number. Based on the {AI}, it was shown that aridity will generally increase under conditions of increased {CO}2 and associated global warming. However, assessing the same climate model output directly suggests a more nuanced response of aridity to global warming, raising the question if the {AI} provides a good representation of the complex nature of anticipated aridity changes. By systematically comparing projections of the {AI} against projections for various hydroclimatological and ecohydrological variables, we show that the {AI} generally provides a rather poor proxy for projected aridity conditions. Direct climate model output is shown to contradict signals of increasing aridity obtained from the {AI} in at least half of the global land area with robust change. We further show that part of this discrepancy can be related to the parameterization of potential evaporation. Especially the most commonly used potential evaporation model likely leads to an overestimation of future aridity due to incorrect assumptions under increasing atmospheric {CO}2. Our results show that {AI}-based approaches do not correctly communicate changes projected by the fully coupled climate models. The solution is to directly analyse the model outputs rather than use a separate offline impact model. We thus urge for a direct and joint assessment of climate model output when assessing future aridity changes rather than using simple index-based impact models that use climate model output as input and are potentially subject to significant biases.},

	abstract = {Drylands are an essential component of the Earth System and are among the most vulnerable to climate change. In this Review, we synthesize observational and modelling evidence to demonstrate emerging differences in dryland aridity dependent on the specific metric considered. Although warming heightens vapour pressure deficit and, thus, atmospheric demand for water in both the observations and the projections, these changes do not wholly propagate to exacerbate soil moisture and runoff deficits. Moreover, counter-intuitively, many arid ecosystems have exhibited significant greening and enhanced vegetation productivity since the 1980s. Such divergence between atmospheric and ecohydrological aridity changes can primarily be related to moisture limitations by dry soils and plant physiological regulations of evapotranspiration under elevated {CO}2. The latter process ameliorates water stress on plant growth and decelerates warming-enhanced water losses from soils, while simultaneously warming and drying the near-surface air. We place these climate-induced aridity changes in the context of exacerbated water scarcity driven by rapidly increasing anthropogenic needs for freshwater to support population growth and economic development. Under future warming, dryland ecosystems might respond non-linearly, caused by, for example, complex ecosystem–hydrology–human interactions and increased mortality risks from drought and heat stress, which is a foremost priority for future research.},

Important lessons emerge by evaluating a set of hypotheses that initially guided the design and longevity of forested {FACE} experiments. Net primary productivity is increased by elevated {CO}2, but the response can diminish over time. Carbon accumulation is driven by the distribution of carbon among plant and soil components with differing turnover rates and by interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Plant community structure may change, but elevated {CO}2 has only minor effects on microbial community structure. {FACE} results provide a strong foundation for next-generation experiments in unexplored ecosystems and inform coupled climate-biogeochemical models of the ecological mechanisms controlling ecosystem response to the rising atmospheric {CO}2 concentration.},

	abstract = {The classical theory of stomatal optimization stipulates that stomata should act to maximize photosynthesis while minimizing transpiration. This theory, despite its remarkable success in reproducing empirical patterns, does not account for the fact that the available water to plants is dynamically regulated by plants themselves, and that plants compete for water in most locations. Here, we develop an alternative theory in which plants maximize the expected carbon gain under stochastic rainfall in a competitive environment. We further incorporate xylem hydraulic limitation as an additional constraint to transpiration and evaluate its impacts on stomatal optimization by incorporating the direct carbon cost of xylem recovery and the opportunity cost of reduced future photosynthesis as a result of irrecoverable xylem damage. We predict stomatal behaviour to be more conservative with a higher cost induced by xylem damage. By varying the unit carbon cost and extent of xylem recovery, characterizing the direct and opportunity cost of xylem damage, respectively, our model can reproduce several key patterns of stomatal-hydraulic trait covariations. By addressing the key elements of water limitation in plant gas exchange simultaneously, including plants’ self-regulation of water availability, competition for water and hydraulic risk, our study provides a comprehensive theoretical basis for understanding stomatal behaviour.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence indicates that the stomatal conductance and nitrogen concentration ([N]) of foliage decline under {CO}2 enrichment, and that the percentage growth response to elevated {CO}2 is amplified under water limitation, but reduced under nitrogen limitation. We advance simple explanations for these responses based on an optimisation hypothesis applied to a simple model of the annual carbon–nitrogen–water economy of trees growing at a {CO}2-enrichment experiment at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, {USA}. The model is shown to have an optimum for leaf [N], stomatal conductance and leaf area index ({LAI}), where annual plant productivity is maximised. The optimisation is represented in terms of a trade-off between {LAI} and stomatal conductance, constrained by water supply, and between {LAI} and leaf [N], constrained by N supply. At elevated {CO}2 the optimum shifts to reduced stomatal conductance and leaf [N] and enhanced {LAI}. The model is applied to years with contrasting rainfall and N uptake. The predicted growth response to elevated {CO}2 is greatest in a dry, high-N year and is reduced in a wet, low-N year. The underlying physiological explanation for this contrast in the effects of water versus nitrogen limitation is that leaf photosynthesis is more sensitive to {CO}2 concentration ([{CO}2]) at lower stomatal conductance and is less sensitive to [{CO}2] at lower leaf [N].},

We reanalyze global greening and account for this issue with a novel statistical method that allows robust inference on greening regions. Based on leaf area index ({LAI}) data, our methods reduce the detected greening from 35.2\% to 15.3\% of the terrestrial land surface; this reduction is most notable in nonwoody vegetation. Our results confirm several greening regions (China, India, Europe, Sahel, North America, Brazil, and Siberia), that are also supported by independent data products. We also report evidence for an increasing seasonal amplitude in {LAI} north of 35°N. Considering the widespread use of spatially replicated trend tests in global change research, we recommend adopting the proposed multiple testing procedure to control false positive outcomes.},

	abstract = {Australia’s terrestrial environment has been dramatically modified since European colonisation. Deforestation – the clearing and modification of native forest for agricultural, urban and industrial development – remains a significant threat to Australia’s biodiversity. Substantial policy reform over the last 40 years has delivered a range of policy instruments aimed to control deforestation across all Australian States and Territories. Despite these policy efforts – as well as strong governance and high institutional capacity – deforestation rates in Australia were nonetheless globally significant at the turn of this century. Legislation introduced in Queensland and New South Wales during the mid-2000s was at the time seen to have effectively ended broad-scale clearing; however, recent policy changes have raised concerns that Australia may again become a global hotspot for deforestation. Here, I describe the deforestation trends, drivers and policy responses in Australia over the last four decades. Using satellite imagery of forest cover and deforestation events across Australia between 1972 and 2014, I present a comprehensive analysis of deforestation rates at a fine resolution. I discuss trends in deforestation with reference to the institutional, macroeconomic and environmental conditions that are associated with human-induced forest loss in Australia. I provide a detailed history and critique of the native vegetation policies introduced across Australia over the last 40 years, including recent legislative amendments and reviews. Finally, I comment on future prospects for curbing deforestation in Australia, including the role of incentive-based policies such as carbon farming, private land conservation and biodiversity offsets. Despite being a highly active policy space, very little is known of the effectiveness of policy responses to deforestation in Australia, and whether the recent shift away from ‘command and control’ policies will necessarily lead to better outcomes. My analysis demonstrates the need for an effective policy mix to curb deforestation in Australia, including a greater focus on monitoring, evaluation and policy learning.},

Hydraulic dysfunction is considered a key mechanism of drought-triggered dieback. By leveraging the climate breadth of the Australian landscape and a national network of research sites (Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network), we conducted a continental-scale study of physiological and hydraulic traits of 33 native tree species from contrasting environments to disentangle the complexities of plant response to drought across communities. We found strong relationships between key plant hydraulic traits and site aridity. Leaf turgor loss point and xylem embolism resistance were correlated with minimum water potential experienced by each species. Across the data set, there was a strong coordination between hydraulic traits, including those linked to hydraulic safety, stomatal regulation and the cost of carbon investment into woody tissue. These results illustrate that aridity has acted as a strong selective pressure, shaping hydraulic traits of tree species across the Australian landscape. Hydraulic safety margins were constrained across sites, with species from wetter sites tending to have smaller safety margin compared with species at drier sites, suggesting trees are operating close to their hydraulic thresholds and forest biomes across the spectrum may be susceptible to shifts in climate that result in the intensification of drought.},

The Eucalyptus Free-Air {CO}2 Enrichment ({EucFACE}) experiment, recently established in a nutrient- and water-limited woodland presents a unique opportunity to address this uncertainty, but can best do so if key model uncertainties have been identified in advance. We applied seven vegetation models, which have previously been comprehensively assessed against earlier forest {FACE} experiments, to simulate a priori possible outcomes from {EucFACE}. Our goals were to provide quantitative projections against which to evaluate data as they are collected, and to identify key measurements that should be made in the experiment to allow discrimination among alternative model assumptions in a postexperiment model intercomparison. Simulated responses of annual net primary productivity ({NPP}) to elevated Ca ranged from 0.5 to 25\% across models. The simulated reduction of {NPP} during a low-rainfall year also varied widely, from 24 to 70\%. Key processes where assumptions caused disagreement among models included nutrient limitations to growth; feedbacks to nutrient uptake; autotrophic respiration; and the impact of low soil moisture availability on plant processes. Knowledge of the causes of variation among models is now guiding data collection in the experiment, with the expectation that the experimental data can optimally inform future model improvements.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-{contentHeaderColor}"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Australia plays an important role in the global terrestrial carbon cycle on inter-annual timescales. While the Australian continent is included in global assessments of the carbon cycle such as the global carbon budget, the performance of dynamic global vegetation models ({DGVMs}) over Australia has rarely been evaluated. We assessed simulations of net biome production ({NBP}) and the carbon stored in vegetation between 1901 to 2018 from 13 {DGVMs} ({TRENDY} v8 ensemble). We focused our analysis on both Australia's short-term (inter-annual) and long-term (decadal to centennial) terrestrial carbon dynamics. The {TRENDY} models simulated differing magnitudes of {NBP} on inter-annual timescales, and these differences contributed to carbon accumulation in the vegetation on decadal to centennial timescales (\&minus;4.7\&ndash;9.5\&thinsp;{PgC}). We compared the {TRENDY} ensemble to several satellite-derived datasets and showed that the spread in the models' simulated carbon storage resulted from varying changes in carbon residence time rather than differences in net carbon uptake. Differences in simulated long-term accumulated {NBP} between models were mostly due to model responses to land-use change. The {DGVMs} also simulated different sensitivities to atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$) concentration, although notably, the models with nutrient cycles did not simulate the smallest {NBP} response to {CO}$_{\textrm{2}}$. Our results suggest that a change in the climate forcing did not have a large impact on the carbon cycle on long timescales. However, the inter-annual variability in precipitation drives the year-to-year variability in {NBP}. We analysed the impact of key modes of climate variability, including the El Nino Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) and the Indian Ocean Dipole ({IOD}) on {NBP}. While the {DGVMs} agreed on sign of the response of {NBP} to El Nino and La Nina, and to positive and negative {IOD} events, the magnitude of inter-annual variability in {NBP} differed strongly between models. In addition, we identified differences in the timing of simulated phenology and fire dynamics associated with differences in simulated/prescribed vegetation composition and process representation. Model disagreement in simulated vegetation carbon, phenology and apparent carbon residence time, indicates the models have different types of vegetation cover across Australia (whether prescribed or emergent). Our study highlights the need to evaluate parameter assumptions and the key processes that drive vegetation dynamics, such as phenology, mortality and fire, in an Australian context to reduce uncertainty across models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
